Time is lengthy for to wait,
for our first date.
I hope it is not a bait,
laid out to catch a mate. 

long been longing for a hug,
hug that will mend my soul.
long been waiting for a mug, 
mug that says "Best Boyfriend".

monsoon is here with the rain,
the rain of a season.
I am here with the pain,
the pain of a lifetime.

the pain of not seeing the person beneath your face,
yet falling for you everyday extensively. 
the pain of not knowing you,
yet loving you immensely.

And now winter is here with the snow,
snow that will bury the little warmth left inside me.
you are the seed of hope that grows,
grows within me to
